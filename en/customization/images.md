# Images

If you want to overwrite any image, firstly you need to findout the filename, and by defaul it will be located under `app/assets/images`. For example if you want to change the header logo (`app/assets/images/logo_header.png`) you must create another file with the exact same file name under `app/assets/images/custom` folder. The images and icons that you will most likely want to change are:

* apple-touch-icon-200.png
* icon_home.png
* logo_email.png
* logo_header.png
* map.jpg
* social_media_icon.png
* social_media_icon_twitter.png
