# Creating your fork

Consul git repo is hosted at Github.com, we recommend using it for your fork's repo to make things easier. But you can use any other service like Bitbucket or Gitlab if you want to.

1. [Register an user account on Github](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one

2. [Create an Organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/) on Github with the name of your city or the organization that's going to use Consul. **This is not mandatory**, but it will help undertand the fork's purpose and future contributions by other users.

3. [Fork Consul](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) using the **fork** button on the top right corner at https://github.com/consul/consul

4. [Clone your fork repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) on to your computer

****IMPORTANT NOTICE**: Do not fork `https://github.com/AyuntamientoMadrid/consul`, its a common mistake that leads to multiple and grave problems
